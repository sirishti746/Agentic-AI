# Agentic-AI 🤖

A simple and beginner-friendly project that shows how an **AI agent** can understand a user’s instruction, break it into steps, and complete tasks automatically — instead of giving just one reply like a normal chatbot.

This notebook demonstrates the basics of **agentic workflows**, planning, reasoning, and multi-step execution using AI models.
